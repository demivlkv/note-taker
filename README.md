## Usage
This application is fairly straightforward. A new note can be added by clicking the `+` icon in the top-right corner of the page. The user will need to enter a note title and its content in order for the save icon to appear next to the `+` icon. The saved note will appear in the left column, along with other previously saved notes. Each saved entry will display a red `delete` button in the side column so that the note can easily be deleted.
